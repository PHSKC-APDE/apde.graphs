\title{Synthetic Wisdom Score Dataset}
\format{
A data.table with 1,000 rows and 3 columns:
\describe{
\item{age}{Numeric. Uniformly distributed ages between 10 and 70 years}
\item{group}{Factor. Study group identifier ("Group 1" or "Group 2")}
\item{wisdom}{Numeric. Synthetic wisdom scores generated using a normal
distribution curve with different parameters for each group. Base score of 20
plus up to 60 points following a normal distribution, with added random noise}
}
}
\source{
Created specifically for demonstrating ggplot2 visualization techniques
including scatter plots, smoothed trend lines, and various plot customizations.
}
\usage{
data(wisdomDT)
}
\description{
A synthetic dataset demonstrating the relationship between age and wisdom scores
across two study groups. The data is designed to show different peak wisdom ages
for each group, with Group 1 peaking around age 40 and Group 2 around age 50.
This dataset is used for demonstrating ggplot2 visualization techniques.
}
\details{
The wisdom scores are generated using different normal distribution
parameters for each group:
\itemize{
\item Group 1: Peak wisdom around age 40 with standard deviation of 25
\item Group 2: Peak wisdom around age 50 with standard deviation of 20
Random noise is added to create
more realistic variation.
