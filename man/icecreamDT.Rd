\description{
A synthetic dataset illustrating the relationship between income levels and
ice cream flavor preferences across different years. The data is designed to
demonstrate various ggplot2 visualization techniques, including trend analysis
and income-based comparisons.
}
\details{
The dataset is synthetically generated with the following characteristics:
\itemize{
\item Base incomes start at different levels for each flavor
\item Incomes trend upward over time with different slopes
\item Random noise added to simulate real-world variability
\item Flavor factor levels are ordered: Chocolate, Vanilla, Other
